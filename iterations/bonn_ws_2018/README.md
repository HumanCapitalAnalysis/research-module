I briefly review some administrative issues regarding the course.

## Guest Lectures

I am very happy to welcome two guest lecturers who will provide brief presentations about their research and the required skills.

#### 22/11/19 [MaxBlesch](https://github.com/MaxBlesch) on [Python Data Analytics](https://giphy.com/gifs/13HgwGsXF0aiGY/html5)

I am going to do a brief introduction on [Python for data analysis: Data wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython](https://www.amazon.de/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662). We are gonna explore some basic python tools on data exploration and cleaning. Using these tools I will present the data handling in my Master Thesis on John Rust's [Optimal replacement of GMC bus engines: An empirical model of Harold Zurcher](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1911259?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).

To prepare for this introduction I highly recommend to read the following [slides](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/seminar/blob/master/slides_guests/Introduction_python.pdf) beforehand and to follow the installation instructions contained.

For students with the aim to fully cover the techniques in [Python for data analysis: Data wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython](https://www.amazon.de/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662) I highly recommend these detailed [Ipython Notebooks](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book), which contain for chapter by chapter notebooks and therefore make a autodidactic learning very easy.


#### 22/11/19 [PatriziaMassner](https://github.com/PatriziaMassner) on [The NLSY Dataset](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/seminar/blob/master/slides_guests/Introduction_nlsy.pdf)

I will present an overview of the NLSY dataset including an introduction of accessing the data. In a next step, I will show how to perform some basic regressions, density plots, and heatmap plots in the Jupyter Notebook motivated by my Master thesis on modeling wage uncertainty in dynamic life-cycle models (based on this paper https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/262080).
