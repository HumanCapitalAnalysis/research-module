## Guest Lectures

I am very happy to welcome two guest lecturers who will provide brief presentations about their research and the required skills.

#### 22/11/19 [MaxBlesch](https://github.com/MaxBlesch) on [Python Data Analytics](https://giphy.com/gifs/13HgwGsXF0aiGY/html5)

I am going to do a brief introduction on [Python for data analysis: Data wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython](https://www.amazon.de/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662). We are gonna explore some basic python tools on data exploration and cleaning. Using these tools I will present the data handling in my Master Thesis on John Rust's [Optimal replacement of GMC bus engines: An empirical model of Harold Zurcher](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1911259?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).

To prepare for this introduction I highly recommend to read the following [slides](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/seminar/blob/master/guest_lectures/Introduction_python.pdf) beforehand and to follow the installation instructions contained.

For students with the aim to fully cover the techniques in [Python for data analysis: Data wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython](https://www.amazon.de/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662) I highly recommend these detailed [Ipython Notebooks](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book), which contain for chapter by chapter notebooks and therefore make a autodidactic learning very easy.


#### 22/11/19 [PatriziaMassner](https://github.com/PatriziaMassner) on [The NLSY Dataset](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/seminar/blob/master/guest_lectures/Introduction_nlsy.pdf)

I will present an overview of the NLSY dataset including an introduction of accessing the data. In a next step, I will show how to perform some basic regressions, density plots, and heatmap plots in the Jupyter Notebook motivated by my Master thesis on modeling wage uncertainty in dynamic life-cycle models (based on this paper https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/262080).

## Manuscript

Please submit your manuscript to Valerie on January 19th. The manuscript cannot exceed 18 pages which includes tables, figures, references, and the appendix. There is no need to provide the data or computer programs.

## Presentations

We only meet on the 22nd of January in the BGSE Seminar room, Kaiserstr. 1. Note that the presentations are 45 minutes for each group with 30 minutes presentation and 15 minutes discussion. Please make sure to either bring along your presentations to the event or post them in advance in our chatroom.
