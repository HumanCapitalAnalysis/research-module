## Student reports

Student summaries of several of the papers discussed in class are available [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/research-module/tree/master/iterations/bonn_ws_2019/student_materials). Please submit your contributions to [Luis Calderon](https://github.com/EconBeast) directly on [slack](https://join.slack.com/t/humancapitalanalysis/shared_invite/enQtNDQ0ODkyODYyODA2LWEyZjdlNWYwYmUyNzlkOWFkNWJkMGI5M2M4ZWUyMThhNWNiMmJhY2ZjY2E4YzE3NGQ5MzcxZTRhN2QxYjgxYWY)

We strongly encourage you to use the framework of an **QAQR** report in preparation for the student reports. The acronym stands for **Q**uote, **A**rgument, **Q**uestion, **R**eflection, and characterizes the four desired outcomes of the report. You should write a report (about 2-3 pages long), where you do the following:

- present a selection of one or more main core arguments from the required literature
- summarize the main arguments
- formulate a question / discussion points
- reflect on the literature and how it is related to topics covered in lecture

## Manuscript

Please submit your manuscript to Liudmila on January 18th. The manuscript cannot exceed 18 pages which includes tables, figures, references, and the appendix. There is no need to provide the data or computer programs.

Please see [here](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/general-resources) for some book recommendations that can help you improving the quality of your manuscript and also assist you in the preparation of the presentation.

## Guest Lectures

#### 13/11/19 [Sebastian Gsell](https://github.com/segsell) on Introduction to the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) data

I am giving an introduction to the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) including a practical example on how to merge and analyze your data.

First, we will make ourselves familiar with the basic data structure and topics covered in the SOEP questionnaires. The [*SOEP Companion*](http://companion.soep.de/) provides all the resources I will use in class. For more, you can check out the corresponding [Youtube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/user/SOEPstudie/).

Second, I will show you three ways to browse for topics and to look up variable definitions:
- [*SOEP Companion*](http://companion.soep.de/Topics%20of%20SOEPcore/index.html)
- Paneldata.org; Browse variables [by topic](https://paneldata.org/soep-core/topics/en) or [search for variables](https://paneldata.org/search/all) directly
- [PDF Documentation](https://www.diw.de/en/diw_02.c.222729.en/questionnaires.html)

Finally, we will look into the research question [“Are married people happier than singles?“](http://companion.soep.de/Working%20with%20SOEP%20Data/Longitudinal%20Data%20Analysis.html) and learn some basic STATA and Python codes for working with SOEP data, in particular, how to merge variables from different data sets.

#### 18/11/19 [Max Blesch](https://github.com/MaxBlesch) on [Python Data Analytics](https://giphy.com/gifs/13HgwGsXF0aiGY/html5)

I am going to do a brief introduction on [Python for data analysis: Data wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython](https://www.amazon.de/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662). We are gonna explore some basic python tools on data exploration and cleaning. Using these tools I will present the data handling in my Master Thesis on John Rust's [Optimal replacement of GMC bus engines: An empirical model of Harold Zurcher](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1911259?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).

To prepare for this introduction I highly recommend to read the following [slides](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/seminar/blob/master/guest_lectures/Introduction_python.pdf) beforehand and to follow the installation instructions contained.

For students with the aim to fully cover the techniques in [Python for data analysis: Data wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython](https://www.amazon.de/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662) I highly recommend these detailed [Ipython Notebooks](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book), which contain for chapter by chapter notebooks and therefore make a autodidactic learning very easy.

#### 18/11/19 [Benedikt Kauf](https://github.com/bekauf) on the NLSY dataset

I will present an overview of the NLSY dataset including an introduction on how to access the data. I will focus mainly on the NLSY 1979 cohort and include several links to further information at the end of [slides](https://github.com/HumanCapitalAnalysis/research-module/blob/master/guest_lectures/NLSY_intro.pdf).
