# Research Seminar

Traditionally economists have emphasized the role of cognitive ability for the formation of human capital. However, influential recent work has challenged that view and promoted a more nuanced picture whereby other skills and character traits – such as motivation and resilience – have a very important role to play. Human capital can hence be broadly defined to comprise every part of the human body and mind that affects economic decision-making or yields economic returns, including skills, personality, character traits and preferences. A recent strand of literature has focused on the formation of human capital and has documented that early-in-life interventions in this dimension may be effective policies to reduce later inequality. In the course, we will follow the development of this important debate and acquire the necessary skills in order to conduct our own research in the area.
